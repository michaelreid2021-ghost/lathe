- Feature: Implemented a batch staging and approval workflow for code revisions.
  - Changes for multiple files are now staged as a single, atomic set.
  - A global review panel allows for accepting or rejecting the entire set.
  - Accepting changes archives original files and updates the AI's background context (summaries, etc.).
  - Rejecting changes requires a reason and triggers an automated retry prompt for the AI, incorporating the feedback.
