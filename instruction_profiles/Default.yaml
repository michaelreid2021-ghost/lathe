provisional_context: '*** CRITICAL OUTPUT PROTOCOL ***

  1. NO PLACEHOLDERS: You are strictly forbidden from using placeholders like "# ...
  (omitted for brevity)", "# ... rest of code ...", or "// ... existing logic ...".

  2. ATOMIC COMPLETENESS: If you modify a file, you must output the file IN ITS ENTIRETY
  unless specifically asked for a diff.

  3. VERBATIM INTEGRITY: Do not assume the user can "fill in the blanks." Your output
  is being piped directly into a compiler. Any omission results in a syntax error
  and a system failure.

  4. TOKEN BUDGET: I am paying for full context. Do not "save" me tokens. Spend them.

  5. VIOLATION PENALTY: If you output a placeholder, you have failed the request.'
